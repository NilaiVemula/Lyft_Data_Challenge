title: "50_Analyzing_Quitters"

We can analyze quitters using the attributes we established before.
Lifetime value can be calculated because we know how long these drivers drove for, so we know their entire lifetime.

# Import Libraries
```{r}
require(tidyverse)
```

# Import Data
```{r}
full <- read_csv("data/full.csv", col_types = cols(timestamp = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%d%.%H:%M:%S%.")))
full

driver_attributes <- read_csv("data/driver_attributes_complete.csv")
driver_attributes
```

```{r}
quitter_attributes <- driver_attributes %>% 
  filter(quit_within_90_days == T) %>% 
  select(-quit_within_90_days) %>% 
  mutate(lifetime_earnings = number_of_rides_given * average_earnings_per_ride) %>% 
  
quitter_attributes
```

```{r}
average_quitter_earnings <- quitter_attributes %>% 
  summarise(mean(lifetime_earnings))
average_quitter_earnings
```
