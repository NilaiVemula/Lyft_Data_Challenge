title: "50_Analyzing_Quitters"

We can analyze quitters using the attributes we established before.
Lifetime value can be calculated because we know how long these drivers drove for, so we know their entire lifetime.

# Import Libraries
```{r}
require(tidyverse)
```

# Import Data
```{r}
full <- read_csv("data/full.csv", col_types = cols(timestamp = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%d%.%H:%M:%S%.")))
full

driver_attributes <- read_csv("data/driver_attributes_complete.csv")
driver_attributes
```

```{r}
quitter_attributes <- driver_attributes %>% 
  filter(quit_within_90_days == T) %>% 
  select(-quit_within_90_days) %>% 
  mutate(lifetime_earnings = number_of_rides_given * average_earnings_per_ride)
  
quitter_attributes
```

```{r}
average_quitter_earnings <- quitter_attributes %>% 
  summarise(`Average Lifetime Value of Quitters (USD)` = round(mean(lifetime_earnings),2))
average_quitter_earnings
```

```{r}
quitter_attributes %>%
  summarise(
    `Average Earnings per Ride (USD)` = round(mean(average_earnings_per_ride), 2),
    
    `Average Ride Distance (miles)` = round(mean(average_ride_distance) * 0.000621371, 2),
    
    `Average Ride Duration (mins)` = round(mean(average_ride_duration) / 60 , 2),
    
    `Average Eagerness` = round(mean(scaled_average_eagerness), 2),
    
    `Average Responsiveness` = round(mean(scaled_average_response_time_ranking), 2),
    
    `Number of Rides Given` = round(mean(number_of_rides_given), 2),
    
    `Average Prime Time Weighted by Ride Duration` = round(mean(average_prime_time_weighted_by_ride_duration), 2),
    
    `Career Length (days)` = round(mean(career_length_in_days), 2)
  )
```

# Analyze Quitter Cluster

```{r}
cluster_assignments <- read_csv(file = "data/cluster_assignments.csv")
quitter_attributes <- left_join(quitter_attributes,cluster_assignments,by="driver_id")

quitter_attributes
```

```{r}
quitter_attributes %>% 
  group_by(cluster) %>% 
  summarise(
    `Average Earnings per Ride (USD)` = round(mean(average_earnings_per_ride), 2),
    
    `Average Ride Distance (miles)` = round(mean(average_ride_distance) * 0.000621371, 2),
    
    `Average Ride Duration (mins)` = round(mean(average_ride_duration) / 60 , 2),
    
    `Average Eagerness` = round(mean(scaled_average_eagerness), 2),
    
    `Average Responsiveness` = round(mean(scaled_average_response_time_ranking), 2),
    
    `Number of Rides Given` = round(mean(number_of_rides_given), 2),
    
    `Average Prime Time Weighted by Ride Duration` = round(mean(average_prime_time_weighted_by_ride_duration), 2),
    
    `Career Length (days)` = round(mean(career_length_in_days), 2),
    
    `Size`= n()
  )
