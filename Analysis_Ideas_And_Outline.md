- Started off with:
  - 937 drivers
  - 193,502 rides
- Analyzing
  - 837 drivers
  - 184,209 rides

## Recommend a Driver's Lifetime Value (i.e., the value of a driver to Lyft over the entire projected lifetime of a driver).

- the wording of this question implies that we don't know what the lifetime of a driver is
- we know the exact value a driver brought to lyft if they quit in 3 months
-
- we can split between quitters and non-quitters and find a formula?


### What are the main factors that affect a driver's lifetime value?
- ideas
  - total revenue brought in
  - total number of rides

- It's clear that the more rides a driver does, the more total value they bring



- Does Lyft care about a driver's driving pattern?
- If Lyft had total control, how many Lyft drivers would they employ and at what time?
- The surge pricing is a way to combat having more riders than drivers. It filters the riders to those willing to pay the highest price.
-

### What is the average projected lifetime of a driver? That is, once a driver is onboarded, how long do they typically continue driving with Lyft?
- Not able to answer this question in full yet
- What we do know:
  - Out of 837 drivers that we have complete ride data for, 259 (30.9%) quit within 90 days
  - Among the drivers that quit within 3 months, the average career lifetime was 34 days

### Do all drivers act alike? Are there specific segments of drivers that generate more value for Lyft than the average driver?
- What does "more value for Lyft than the average driver mean?"
  - does this mean more total value or value per unit time or ride
- We should analyze this problem disregarding the total amount a driver has made. Instead, we want to take a look at amount made per ride or amount made per time

Statistics for the Average Driver:

- Number of rides: 220
- Mean earnings per ride: $13.64
- Mean ride distance: 4.47 miles
- Mean ride duration: 14.33 minutes
- Mean scaled eagerness: 0.67
- Mean scaled response time: 0.67
- Mean prime time weighted by durations: 16.57



- quitters that will quit after 40 rides
- quitters that quit after more than 40 rides
- non quitters strategic (low volume, high earnings per ride, high speed)
- non quitters spammers

### What actionable recommendations are there for the business?
- take more money from driver's with higher insurance costs
- to make quitters not quit
  - aimed at the quitters that quit after 40 rides
  - incentive program beginning at 50 rides
  - we suspect that these quitters are quitting due to burnout (still need evidence)
