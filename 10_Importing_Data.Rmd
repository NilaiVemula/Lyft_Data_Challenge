# Import Libraries
`tidyverse` is a collection of packages for R designed with a consistent methodology.

```{r setup}
require(tidyverse)
```

# Import Dataset
`readr` is used to import the datasets. Take note of the datetime format and the factor levels for events
```{r import data files}
driver_ids <- read_csv("data/driver_ids.csv", 
    col_types = cols(driver_onboard_date = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")))

ride_ids <- read_csv("data/ride_ids.csv", 
    col_types = cols(driver_id = col_character(), 
        ride_distance = col_double(), ride_duration = col_double(), 
        ride_id = col_character(), ride_prime_time = col_double()))

ride_timestamps <- read_csv("data/ride_timestamps.csv", 
    col_types = cols(event = col_factor(levels = c("requested_at", 
        "accepted_at", "arrived_at", "picked_up_at", 
        "dropped_off_at")), ride_id = col_character(), 
        timestamp = col_datetime(format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")))
```

# Preview Data
```{r}
driver_ids
```

There are 937 drivers.

```{r}
ride_ids
```

There are 193,502 rides.

```{r}
ride_timestamps
```

```{r}
ride_timestamps %>% filter(is.na(timestamp))
```

```{r}
ride_timestamps <- ride_timestamps %>% filter(!is.na(timestamp))
dim(ride_timestamps)
```


```{r}
library(lubridate)
last_timestamp <- ride_timestamps %>% drop_na()
last_recorded_timestamp <- (max(last_timestamp$timestamp))
last_recorded_timestamp

first_recorded_timestamp <- (min(last_timestamp$timestamp))
first_recorded_timestamp

length_of_study <- last_recorded_timestamp-first_recorded_timestamp
length_of_study

```

# Combine Data into full dataset

```{r}
full <- full_join(ride_ids,ride_timestamps,by="ride_id") %>%  full_join(driver_ids,by="driver_id")
full
```

```{r}
full <- full %>% drop_na()
full
```

## Calculating Ride Fare
```{r}
earnings <- full %>% filter(event=="dropped_off_at") %>% select(ride_id, ride_distance, ride_duration, ride_prime_time) %>% mutate(unbound_driver_earnings = (2+1.75+1.15*ride_distance*0.000621371 + 0.22*(ride_duration/60)*((100+ride_prime_time)/100))) %>% mutate( driver_earnings = ifelse(unbound_driver_earnings<5,5,ifelse(unbound_driver_earnings>400,400,unbound_driver_earnings))) %>% select(ride_id,driver_earnings)

earnings
```

```{r}
full <- full_join(full, earnings, by="ride_id")
dim(full)
```

```{r}
write_csv(full, path = "data/full.csv")
```
